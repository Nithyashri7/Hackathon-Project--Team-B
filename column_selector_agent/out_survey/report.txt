Selection Table:

| Column | Status | Biological Reason |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| self_employed | Selected (TARGET) | Target variable used for outcome modeling and clinical interpretation. |
| no_employees | Selected | no_employees reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| Timestamp | Selected | Timestamp reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| remote_work | Selected | remote_work is a core cardiovascular risk marker tied to atherosclerotic burden and clinical events. |
| benefits | Selected | benefits reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| leave | Selected | leave modifies prognosis through physiological reserve and comorbidity influence. |
| state | Selected | state reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| Age | Selected | Age reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| mental_vs_physical | Selected | mental_vs_physical reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| Country | Selected | Country reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| seek_help | Selected | seek_help reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| anonymity | Selected | anonymity modifies prognosis through physiological reserve and comorbidity influence. |
| phys_health_consequence | Selected | phys_health_consequence is a core cardiovascular risk marker tied to atherosclerotic burden and clinical events. |
| mental_health_consequence | Selected | mental_health_consequence modifies prognosis through physiological reserve and comorbidity influence. |
| Gender | Selected | Gender is a core cardiovascular risk marker tied to atherosclerotic burden and clinical events. |
| work_interfere | Selected | work_interfere reflects myocardial function or ischemic response, directly linked to symptomatic disease. |
| mental_health_interview | Selected | mental_health_interview is a core cardiovascular risk marker tied to atherosclerotic burden and clinical events. |
| family_history | Rejected | family_history is influenced by confounders and rarely adds incremental clinical mechanistic information beyond core biomarkers. |
| treatment | Rejected | treatment is often a technical or administrative field rather than a mechanism-linked biomarker. |
| tech_company | Rejected | tech_company is influenced by confounders and rarely adds incremental clinical mechanistic information beyond core biomarkers. |
| care_options | Rejected | care_options is often a technical or administrative field rather than a mechanism-linked biomarker. |
| wellness_program | Rejected | wellness_program is influenced by confounders and rarely adds incremental clinical mechanistic information beyond core biomarkers. |
| coworkers | Rejected | coworkers is influenced by confounders and rarely adds incremental clinical mechanistic information beyond core biomarkers. |
| supervisor | Rejected | supervisor is often a technical or administrative field rather than a mechanism-linked biomarker. |
| phys_health_interview | Rejected | phys_health_interview is often a technical or administrative field rather than a mechanism-linked biomarker. |
| obs_consequence | Rejected | obs_consequence is influenced by confounders and rarely adds incremental clinical mechanistic information beyond core biomarkers. |
| comments | Rejected | comments is often a technical or administrative field rather than a mechanism-linked biomarker. |

Notes:
- This table is tailored for clinical / biological interpretation. It intentionally omits numeric summaries (min/max/mean).
- Detailed numeric metadata for selected features is stored in metadata.json.
