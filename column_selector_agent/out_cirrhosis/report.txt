Selection Table:

| Column        | Status            | Biological Reason                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stage         | Selected (TARGET) | This is the main outcome variable for clinical interpretation.                                    |
| N_Days        | Selected          | N_Days signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis.        |
| Albumin       | Selected          | Albumin measures hepatic protein synthesis; low levels reflect advanced liver dysfunction.        |
| Copper        | Selected          | Copper signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis.        |
| Platelets     | Selected          | Platelets reflects hepatic excretory or synthetic impairment, mapping to cirrhosis severity.      |
| Prothrombin   | Selected          | Prothrombin reflects clotting factor synthesis; prolongation suggests hepatic synthetic failure.  |
| Bilirubin     | Selected          | Bilirubin reflects impaired bile excretion; elevation signals worsening hepatic function.         |
| Age           | Selected          | Age signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis.           |
| SGOT          | Selected          | SGOT indicates deranged liver processing capacity, often preceding clinical deterioration.        |
| Tryglicerides | Selected          | Tryglicerides signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis. |
| Alk_Phos      | Selected          | Alk_Phos signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis.      |
| ID            | Selected          | ID signals portal hypertension or hepatocellular injury relevant to patient prognosis.            |
| Status        | Rejected          | Status does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                     |
| Drug          | Rejected          | Drug does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                       |
| Sex           | Rejected          | Sex does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                        |
| Ascites       | Rejected          | Ascites does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                    |
| Hepatomegaly  | Rejected          | Hepatomegaly does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.               |
| Spiders       | Rejected          | Spiders is an identifier without biological relevance.                                            |
| Edema         | Rejected          | Edema does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                      |
| Cholesterol   | Rejected          | Cholesterol does not directly reflect liver pathophysiology and was deprioritized.                |
